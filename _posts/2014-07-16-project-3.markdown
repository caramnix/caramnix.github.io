description: Utilizing cutting-edge geospatial and redistricting technologies, I investigate the impacts of redistricting at the school district and attendance zone level. First, by analyzing the existing boundaries and then by generating alternative districting plans. I explore if current boundaries are giving a specific racial group an educational advantage over another. This educational gerrymandering has normative implications as well as empirical realities for student achievement disparities within a state. I focus on educational boundaries within Minnesota, specifically, 79 school districts and 331 attendance zones. Comparing these geographic realities to alternative computer-generated boundaries, I find that, due to histories of red-lining and segregative politics, the existing attendance zones are less racially representative of the underlying population than those computer-generated. A statewide analysis of these educational boundaries allows for data-rich analyses of racial disparities within Minnesota’s education system.
