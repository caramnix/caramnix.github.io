description: Instances of police brutality have been shown to have a catalyzing effect on the electorate. For example, following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 voter turnout in the 2021 mayoral election increased over 53 percent from 2017. However, despite a massive change in turnout indicating the mobilizing effect of police killings, Mayor Jacob Frey still won reelection in 2021. This puzzle of accountability is what I will explore further and put to the test at a national-level. Using data from police killings which occurred in medium and large (greater 50,000 people) cities from 2013-2021 and corresponding mayoral election returns I consider the impact of police brutality on turnout, democratic vote share and incumbency vote choice. I expect to find turnout and democratic vote share in the mayoral election will increase following instances of police brutality. I also expect, relative to cities where there were no instances of police brutality, incumbency percentage will decrease, suggesting mayors are being “punished” for police brutality happening on their watch. However, I expect this effect is not large enough to unseat the incumbent, demonstrating contradictory outcomes: increased mobilization, yet incumbent reelection- indicating a lack of mayoral accountability. I leverage the as-if random timing and location of instances of police brutality to implement a differences in differences design spanning multiple time periods. I also run a supplementary mediation analysis using local awareness as a mediator. Results indicate marginal effects of police killing on turnout, democratic vote share and incumbency support. This research highlights the limitations of elections at holding elected officials accountable for police brutality.
