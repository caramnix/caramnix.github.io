description: Instances of police brutality have been shown to have a catalyzing effect on the
electorate. For example, following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020
voter turnout in the 2021 mayoral election increased over 53 percent from 2017. How-
ever, despite a massive change in turnout indicating the mobilizing effect of police
killings, Mayor Jacob Frey still won reelection in 2021. This puzzle of accountability
is what I wish to explore further and put to the test at a national-level. Using data
from police killings which occurred in “large” (more than 50,000 people) cities from 2014-2022
and corresponding mayoral election returns I consider the impact of police brutality on
turnout, democratic vote share and incumbency vote choice. I expect to find turnout
and democratic vote share in the mayoral election will increase following instances
of police brutality. I also expect, relative to cities where there were no instances of
police brutality, incumbency percentage will decrease, suggesting mayors are being
“punished” for police brutality happening on their watch. However, I expect this effect
is not large enough to unseat the incumbent, demonstrating contradictory outcomes:
increased mobilization, yet incumbent reelection- indicating a lack of mayoral account-
ability. I leverage the as-if random timing and location of instances of police brutality
to implement a differences in differences design spanning multiple time periods. I also
run a supplementary mediation analysis using local awareness as a mediator. This re-
search highlights the limitations of elections at holding our elected officials accountable
for police brutality.
