description: Legislators communicate with constituents for a multitude of reasons. Campaigning,
fundraising, and informing them of bills they are working on, or issues they are passionate
about. Prior to the late 1970s it was difficult for legislators to communicate with their
constituents, let alone the mass public. With the introduction of C-SPAN televising House
floor debates in 1979 as well as the introduction of social media platforms such as Twitter
in 2006, this provided legislators with new ways to communicate with their constituents
and new data sources for analysis. This project explores variation in sentiment and emotion across the 115th, 116th,
and 117th Congresses which includes a period of Republican unified control (115th), split
government (116th), and Democrat unified control (117th). Additionally, two forms of
legislator communication are considered, one-minute speeches delivered to the House floor
and tweets from legislators. The results indicate when a political party has unified control over the government
its members have higher sentiment than the minority party. This suggests the national
political landscape impacts the language of legislators both on Twitter and on the House
floor. Deeper analysis is also done on one-minute speeches given on the House floor by
expanding on the valence-arousal-confidence framework originally introduced by Mehrabian
and Russell (1974) to also include empathy and sympathy. Here, results indicate varying
confidence and valence depending on party control of the government.
