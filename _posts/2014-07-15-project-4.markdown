description: Legislators communicate with constituents for a multitude of reasons. Prior to the late 1970s it was difficult for legislators to communicate with their constituents, let alone the mass public.  With the introduction of C-SPAN televising House floor debates in 1979 as well as the introduction of social media platforms such as Twitter in 2006, this provided legislators with new ways to communicate with their constituents and new data sources for analysis. This project explores variation in sentiment and emotion across the 115th, 116th, and 117th Congresses which includes a period of Republican unified control (115th), split government (116th), and Democrat unified control (117th).
